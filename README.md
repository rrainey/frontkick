## Google Fonts 

I used some Google fonts in this project. E-paper bitmaps generated from the Google Comfortaa font are used in the Wrist display project.  These fonts are free for commercial use. More information 
can be found at the [Google Fonts web site](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq).

The e-paper graphics library required these fonts be in Adafruit GFX format. I used this excellent web-based converter to generate the GFX files from the original Truetype format distribed by Google:  https://rop.nl/truetype2gfx/
